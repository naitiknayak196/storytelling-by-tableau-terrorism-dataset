Global Terrorism Dataset Analysis

Overview

Terrorism is a pressing issue affecting nations across the world. Our project aims to analyze terrorism data comprehensively to extract meaningful insights and trends. This project was part of our Data Visualization class, where we used Python for data cleaning, Tableau for storytelling, and PowerPoint for our final presentation.

Dataset

We used the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a large-scale dataset containing detailed records of terrorist incidents worldwide. The dataset includes:

Date and location of attacks

Types of attacks

Groups responsible

Casualties and damages

Weapons used

Files Included

globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv - The original dataset

cleaned_terrorism_data.csv - The cleaned dataset

Global Terrorism Dataset Analysis.ipynb - Python Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing

Global Terrorism Presentation.pdf - Final PowerPoint presentation used for storytelling

Data Cleaning Process

Given the massive size and complexity of the dataset, we performed extensive cleaning using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib):

Removed irrelevant columns to focus on key variables.

Handled missing values by imputing or removing where necessary.

Standardized date formats and location names.

Transformed categorical variables for easier analysis.

Derived new insights by creating additional features.

Storytelling & Visualization (Tableau)

Our approach to storytelling revolved around answering "WHY?" â€“ Why do people engage in terrorism? We aimed to provide an unbiased, data-driven perspective to shed light on these patterns.

Key Insights

Geographical Patterns: Terrorism is more prevalent in certain regions due to political instability.

Trends Over Time: The frequency of attacks has evolved over decades, peaking in certain years.

Targeted Groups: Civilians and government institutions are the most targeted entities.

Psychological Aspects: Socioeconomic conditions contribute significantly to radicalization.

Visualizations Created

Heatmaps of global terrorist attacks

Time-series plots showing trends over decades

Bar charts & pie charts analyzing attack types and targets

Geospatial maps highlighting affected regions

Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Data cleaning (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Tableau: Data visualization & storytelling

PowerPoint: Final presentation

Presentation Highlights

Our PowerPoint presentation emphasized not just the data but the human cost of terrorism. We structured it around key psychological and sociological factors that contribute to radicalization. Some of the critical questions addressed were:

Why do individuals, even educated ones, turn to terrorism?

What societal factors push individuals into extremist groups?

How can we use data to predict and prevent future attacks?

Future Scope

Implementing Machine Learning models to predict potential terrorism hotspots.

Conducting sentiment analysis on global terrorism reports and news.

Expanding our Tableau dashboard for real-time interactive insights.
